Hi, weekly update from the Pace Team!


   - Week behind This week is marked as Sprint #1 During the last few
   weeks, We've built several pretotypes, such like text message, google form,
   etc Along with that, we refined our pretotype through protoio In the
   sprint, we went outside talking to people to validate our ideas and collect
   helpful information to improve our app
   - Week ahead This week we'll dive deeper into making the prototype
   and talk with some potential partners about our app
   - Risks The biggest risk we meet is that we need to verify our
   product's target We need to ensure that people will use our app to play
   board games
