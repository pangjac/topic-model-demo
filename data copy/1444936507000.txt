Hi,I'm Bochen Wang, a cornell tech student And my NetId is bw475
I received an email says that the grad admission didn't receive my final
transcript
But I've submitted the transcript at the International student
registration
Do I need to submit my diploma to you?
If I do need, must I send the paper copy to you or just scan it and email
to you?

Thanks,
Bochen Wang
