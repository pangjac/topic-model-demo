Hey Bochen,
 
Thank you for your interest in AVA Belltown  My name is Aaron and I would love to help you find your new home
AVA Belltown is located in the lively, downtown adjacent neighborhood of Belltown  We have the Olympic Sculpture Park as our front yard, many amazing shops, cafes, restaurants and attractions within a few blocks of our fantastic community, including the iconic Seattle Center and Space Needle  
To get started, is there anything specific you are looking for in your new home?  Anything on your wish list?  
For a June move in, we wont know of our availability until about 30 days ahead of time as Washington only requires a 20 day notice when moving out 
You can see all of our floor plans, availability, photos and pricing in real time, on our website, wwwAVABelltowncom, anytime  You can even lease your new apartment from here too!
I would love to show you around AVA Belltown I have 11am today or 3pm on Tuesday  What works best for you? If those times don't work, please let me know what works best with your schedule 
I look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your perfect apartment!
