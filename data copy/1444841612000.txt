Hi scrum,

Here is our weekly update:

Week Behind
We met with our mentors, Rachel & Jeff, to review the user research they
performed  After unpacking the new information, we went back to the
drawing board We throught of three new product narratives, based on
Intersections target users We began developing a pretotype and survey to
validate our ideas

Week Ahead
We plan to distribute the survey accross the internet  The pretotype will
be shown to people in-person, followed by an interview  We will gather the
results from our interviews and surveys, modify our idea as necessary, and
review our approach with our mentors

Risks
The major risk we see is in validating our assumptions quickly enough to
get a prototype up and running in time We need to reach out to a broader
audience and iterate quickly on how to balance the game to motivate the
users

Homework
We recorded our pitch video
,
based on our sprint presentation We also created a draft of our survey



Thanks,
Derek & team
