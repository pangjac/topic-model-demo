Hi everyone,

Here is our weekly update

Narrative:
A photo sharing service through which people share photos of themselves and
tag the clothes they wear, which will be recommended to consumers with
similar body shape In this way, consumers can find the clothes that fit
them best

Week behind:
1 In our weekly mini sprint, we refined our NCP Now we encourage
customers to upload the photos when they try the clothes on And we also
tried to figure out if the barcode scanning can be used in our app
2 We held the postmortem process, we reflected on our work assignment and
time management

Week ahead:
1 Building the NCP of our product
2 Test our product with customers

Challenges:
1 Whether customers will upload the photos
2 UI Design for our NCP

Best,
Bochen, Fan, Shimiao, Tianyuan
