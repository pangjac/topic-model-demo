
Hi folks,

After our case study session today, James had a suggestion that a the presenting groups are identified in advance and b the presenting groups work on the slides before coming to the class I had the opportunity to discuss this with several class members who agreed with the suggestion I outline the path forward below

Case Study Presentations - Presenting Groups

I will identify the presenting groups in advance and the presentation is to be worked on by the group prior to coming to the class There will be no time allocated in class for working on the presentation

The groups have to prepare and submit slides, or essay form if they prefer, addressing ALL the Issues for their assigned case study, and will present only on ONE specific Issue

Only presenting groups will submit their full complete slides or essay form if they prefer by 1159 pm at the end of the day they present

Case Study - Non-presenting Groups

For non-presenting groups, I expect you to have read the case study so that you are ready to engage in discussions during class I encourage you to directly email me up to 1 page of your thoughts on the case BEFORE the session starts I will consider this as part of the Individual Contributions component in the Grading scheme
