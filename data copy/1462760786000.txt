Hi Everyone,

Below is the random order for class and Startup Award presentations for Tuesday The judges for the Startup Awards are also listed below

If you require any special technical setup besides an HDMI adaptor or anything else like tables, etc for your presentation, please let me know

All the presentations will be held in the Studio The tables and chairs in the front row will be reserved for the judges, feel free to sit anywhere else to watch your classmates

There will be chairs by the Buildboard for the 'on deck' teams to make sure the transition goes quickly from team to team When the team before you is presenting, make sure you are in those seats so you can get to the front and set up easily If you want to use a clicker but don't have your own, this is the time that you will set your computer up with the clicker I will have a few There will be hand held mics for everyone to use total of 4

Please let me know if you have questions

Thanks!
