Hi Everyone,

Now is the time to start thinking about OPT if you haven't done so already Attached you will find all the information you need about applying for OPT Please set aside some time to review the entire packet in its entirety Other resources include the video from the fall on our wiki thoroughly

A few quick tips on the timing of your application:

?  You can't apply for OPT more than 90 days before the end of your program The end date is found on your I-20, and I can almost guarantee that everyone's end date is May 29 This means that February 29 is the first day you can submit your application for OPT

?  Your OPT start date must be no more than 60 days after graduation This means your start date should be between May 30 and July 28

?  Keep in mind that you can't apply more than 120 days before your chose start date Ex If you select July 28 as your start date, you can't apply until March 28

?  Please, please, please apply as early as feasibly possible The later you apply, the further behind your application gets Remember that all graduating international students in the United States are applying for OPT at pretty much the same time Applications are reviewed in the order they're received-your application will sit at the bottom of the pile if you apply late Last year a couple of students applied in April and it took them FOREVER to get their OPT cards-they had to push back their start dates for their jobs because it's illegal to begin work until you have your OPT card

?  Your application must be received within 30 days of me issuing your new I-20 Don't forget to send in your application!

So, take a look at all of the information and let me know if you have any questions I'm here to help!
