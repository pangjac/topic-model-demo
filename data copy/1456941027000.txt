2       All Cornell diplomas are ordered with the official name of record primary name for each student  You must check your PRIMARY name on your Student Center account instructions


3       If submitting an official name change, you also must inform your field GFA and the Engineering Registrar's Office to ensure your diploma name is correct   If simply adding a diacritical mark or capitalization to your existing primary name, just inform your field GFA and the Engineering Registrar's Office since those changes do not have to go through the official process referenced above
