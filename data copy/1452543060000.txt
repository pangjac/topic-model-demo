Hello Bochen,

I hope you had a great end of your semester last month and great holidays!
Happy 2016!

I do have an update to share with you regarding your interview in early
December -- Did you happen to get my previous emails? Let me know if you
are free to chat this week so that I can share the update with Send along
your PST availability and I'll take a look at my calendar so I can give you
a call asap! Also, let me know the best number where I can reach you!

Best,
Cristina
