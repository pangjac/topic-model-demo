Hi all,

This is the Pace Team and here is what we did this week, what we plan to do
next week, our risks, and our homework

Week Behind
This week we met with our mentor As per our business for tech class, we
wanted to know what were Pace's goals for the company challenge and what
were their success metrics Pace really wanted us to learn about product
development and develop a product that people will really enjoy even if the
audience isn't very large Anything that we learn will hopefully help Pace
learn as well For the second sprint, Steve gave us the goal of gathering 5
strangers through our product and have them play a game together In
addition to meeting with Steve, we also scouted some venues that host
social gaming events In particular we visited Montasy Comics and Fat Cat
as possible locations to play at and perhaps partner with We also reached
out to the owner of Uncommons and introduced our project to him

Week Ahead
For the coming week, we will record our pitch video and have it submitted
to our Dropbox We have also scheduled another meeting with our mentor for
Thursday We are also making arrangements to speak with a board game shop
owner to gather more insight as well as a possible partnership opportunity
On the side, we will be researching existing social apps such as Weave,
Tinder, and assorted sports-related ones to model our NCP on

Risks
Although we would are planning to build a mobile app, we do not know the
distribution of iOS to Android users among board game players We are
considering a web interface to mitigate this risk There is also the risk
that existing social apps might not be the best product for board game
players to use We may need another round of crazy 8s to come up with an
original solution that players will enjoy

Homework
For this week, we were not able to find a time to record our pitch, but we
will have it done before the next lecture In the meantime, we have started
our Dropbox

We have also been managing our tasks on Trello
 We have also been using our Twitter
 to plug events and connect with members
in the board game community We are at 29 followers!

Warm regards,

Pace Team
